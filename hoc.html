           <p style="color:darkblue;"><strong>About Event</strong></p>
           
         <p>At our Hour of Code event, we as Team 24 told the children about computer science and ADA University and played interesting
        logical games for them. In our event, we allocated half time for entertainment and half for information, so that children do not feel that
        coding is just another tiring activity. <br><br> First, we gave the children brief information about our university and the life there, and then about
        the <a href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">code.org</a> website. <br><br> When it comes to games, we have prepared 2 of them.
        One of them was <a href="https://code.org/" target="_blank">code.org</a> and the other was a game we made without a computer. <br><br>
        In the end, after gathering all our knowledge, we talked about how coding will affect the children's future lives, what jobs they can do with it,
        and how they can improve themselves.</p>

        <h1>Hour of Code Event of Team 24</h1>
        <!-- links, imgs, video and short report about it-->
        <p>Recently, we, as Team 24, conducted "Hour of Code" Event, at Mehdiabad School â„–4. 
            <p style="color:darkblue;"><strong>Brief report</strong></p>
        <p>At our Hour of Code event, we as Team 24 informed the children about computer science and ADA University and played interesting and logical games for them. In our event, we allocated half time for entertainment and half for information, so that children do not feel that coding is just a tiring activity. First, we gave the children brief information about our university and the life there, and then about the code.org website. When it comes to games, we have prepared 2 games. One of them was code.org and the other was a game we made without a computer. In the end, after gathering all our knowledge, we talked about how coding will affect the children's future lives, what jobs they can do with it, and how they can improve themselves.</p>

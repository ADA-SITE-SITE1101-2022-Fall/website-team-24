        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <!-- <p> info about task and uni </p> -->
        <p>As SuperGirls, our mission is to learn basics of <strong>web-design</strong> and <strong>site making</strong>. With the help of HTML and CSS we
        tried to create a website from scratch! Hope you will like our first site and find it attractive. After an amazing event - Hour of Code,
        now it is our group's 3rd project - <strong><em>How Website Works</em></strong>.</p>

                I love being a student here, because of a lot of social activities, fun times with my friends and of course teaching methods of our
                instructors. <br>
                My goal is to have a successful career in cyber-security field and showing that women also can be strong in this area :) </p>

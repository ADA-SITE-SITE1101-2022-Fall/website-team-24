        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <!-- <p> info about task and uni </p> -->
        <p>As a SuperGirls our mission is to learn basics of <strong>web-design</strong> and <strong>site making</strong>. With the help of HTML and CSS we tried to create a website from zero! Hope you will like our first site and find it 
        attractive. After a amazing event - Hour of Code, now it is our group's 3th project - <strong><em>How Website Works</em></strong>.</p>

            <li><strong>Rahida</strong></li>
             <p>Hello everyone who visits our nice website! I am a first-year student - <em>Rahida </em>from <strong>IT</strong>  faculty of ADA university.
                A little bit about me: my interest areas are puzzles, sport, music, cyber-security and my university life. 
                I love being student here, because of a lot of social activities, funny times with my friends and of course teaching methods of our instructors.
                My aim is to have a successful career in cyber-security field and showing that women also can be successful in this area :) </p>
            <li><strong>Aysel</strong></li>
            <p>My name is <em> Aysel Panakhova</em>. I am a first year student of the <strong> IT </strong> major at 
                <em>ADA University</em>.
                I chose this department because I have been interested in information technology and coding for several years.
                My <em>hobbies</em> are listening to jazz, slow rock and techno music, knitting, drawing and taking pictures of every 
                beautiful scene or object I see around me.
                In addition, my <em>skills</em> include playing national dance, painting with oil paint and knitting.</p>
